In this Online Exhibition Portal we have three roles 1.ADMIN 2.EXHIBITOR 3.USER

1.ADMIN - Admin need to accept the exhibitor registration request 2.EXHIBITOR – Exhibitor need to make Register request, after sucessfully registered they can able to create only one stall by providing stall details like stall id (auto increment) , stall name, stall description, stall photoUrl, stall videoUrl, stall broucherUrl and they can manage and edit their own stalls

3.USER – If user Registered sucessfully, they can view the list of stalls one by one Need to make a login and register page, by validating details need to authenticate the users based on their roles

Note: 1.We need to restrict the exhibitor by ensuring that one exhibitor can able to create only only stall 2.Need to map a stall id with exhibitor id 3.By stall Id need to fetch the stall details Ex: https://localhost:8080/stall/1
